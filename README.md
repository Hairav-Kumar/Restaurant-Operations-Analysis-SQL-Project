Restaurant Operations Analysis – SQL Project

Project Overview:
In this project, I stepped into the role of a Data Analyst for Taste of the World Café, a restaurant with a newly launched diverse menu. 
The goal was to analyze menu and order data to uncover performance insights and customer preferences.

Datasets Used:
menu_items: Contains details about each dish (e.g., name, category, price)
order_details: Records customer orders, items ordered, and timestamps

Key Objectives:
Explore the menu_items table to understand the new menu.
Analyze the order_details table to uncover customer behavior.
Combine both tables to discover which dishes and categories perform best.

Questions Explored:
Menu Analysis
How many items are on the menu?
What are the least and most expensive items?
How many Italian dishes are there?
Average price and number of items per category

Order Analysis
Date range of customer orders
Total number of orders and items ordered
Which orders had the most items?
How many orders had more than 12 items?

Combined Insights
Most and least ordered items + their categories
Top 5 highest-spending orders and insights from their details

Tools & Skills Used:
SQL (MySQL)
Data Exploration, Filtering, Aggregation
Joins, Grouping, Ordering, and Case-Based Analysis

Outcome:
Delivered actionable insights into:
Top-performing dishes and categories
High-value customers and their preferences
Strategic recommendations for menu optimization
